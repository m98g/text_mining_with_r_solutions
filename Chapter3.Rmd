## Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf

In this chapter we will explore how important a single word is
to a document.

tf - term frequency
idf - inverse document frequency -- basically weights applied based on how often a word appears

TF in Jane Austen

library(tidytext)

#load the austen books
book_words <- austen_books() %>% 
  # tokenization on word level
  # one word per row
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  # count how often a given word is in a book
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  # the data is grouped and we ungroup it so we can 
  # do operations on the whole dataset
  ungroup()

total_words <- book_words %>% 
  # we group the data based on which book
  group_by(book) %>% 
  # gives us a dataframe with two variables, the book, and the total sum of words
  summarize(total = sum(n))

# we join our two dataframes 
# so left join adds the column that is not in the left (x) dataset from the 
# right dataset (y) in this case its the total word count and matches it to the
# coresponding book
book_words <- left_join(book_words, total_words)
book_words

library(ggplot2)

# plotting the
ggplot(book_words, aes(n/total, fill = book)) +
  #histogram
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE)+
  # NA is basically leaving the arguemnt empty
  # this will take the limit from the data itself
  # if the larger limit is given first reversed grpah, like its the case here
  # o.0009 is the lower bound
  # limits the bound if the x-axis
  xlim(NA, 0.0009) +
  # split the grpah based on the book with to columns of graphs and a free y axis
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y")
``` 

Zip's Law:
Zipfâ€™s law states that the frequency that a word appears is inversely proportional to its rank.

```{r}
freq_by_rank <- book_words %>% 
  # group the data
  group_by(book) %>% 
  # we create two new variables (columns)
  # first we compute a rank that is the row number,
  # as this data is based on the frequnecy we get the rank, based on
  # often a word appears in a given book
  
  # the seocnd variable is the percentage of how often the word
  # appears compared to all the other words
  mutate(rank = row_number(),
         `term frequency` = n/total)

freq_by_rank
```


```{r}
# here we plot the term frequency
freq_by_rank %>% 
  # why has there to be these `` around term frequency... maybe its because of 
  # the whitespace between
  
  # plot based on the rank on the x axis and frequency on the y axis
  # color the individual books differently
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = book)) +
  # line plot
  # size
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

```{r}
rank_subset <- freq_by_rank %>% 
  filter(rank < 500,
         rank > 10)

lm(log10(`term frequency`) ~ log10(rank), data = rank_subset)
```
```{r}
# with abline we can add another line in our graph with
# parameters defined by us
freq_by_rank %>%
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = book)) +
  # add another line in the graph with fixed parameters
  # linetype 2 is a dotted line
  geom_abline(intercept = -0.62, slope = -1.1, color = "gray50", linetype = 2) +
  # our type of graph
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  # this scales the x and y axis to log10
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()

```

```{r}
# how often a given word is in each book
book_words <- book_words %>%
  # calc term frequency and inverse document frequency
  # then bind these two to the given dataframe
  # in this case book_words
  # as we store this again in book_words (override)
  # we basically get two new columns

  # tf, idf, and tf_idf

  # arrange

  # values attached
